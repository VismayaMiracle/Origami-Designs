Hello!😇

I hope you are fine and safe. This web Page helps you to create and know more about Origami Designs 
and shapes. Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). 
Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes). An ancient Japanese legend says 
if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish. 

Good Luck!👍
